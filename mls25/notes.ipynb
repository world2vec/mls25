The friend states V reportedly returned from out of state four days prior where he attended a music festival. V is known to sometimes smoke weed or occasionally eat psilocybin mushrooms.

       "3998                             At 0100 hours, local police received a call of shots fired. Upon arrival, officers did not get a response and proceeded to make a forced entry. They discovered the deceased bodies of a XX XX (V1) and her son, a 2-year-old XX (V2) lying on the bed in the master bedroom having sustained multiple gunshot wounds. V1 was laying on top of her son with her right arm over the top of him, as though she was trying to protect him. Her right arm had 3-4 gunshot wounds that shattered her arm. V1's husband, a XX XX (S) was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head and 9mm handgun resting in his hand. S still had agonal breathing, so he was transported to the hospital where he later died at 0333 hours. Fourteen 9mm casings were recovered from the bedroom where the homicide and suicide took place. Neighbors reported hearing 2-5 shots, so it is unclear how the other 9-12 shots were made quieter. It should be noted that V1 was pregnant at the time of the incident.   \n",
